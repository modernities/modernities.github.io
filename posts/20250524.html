<p>I went up to Gotokuji again, to see the chrysanthemums and the cat statues. I stood under the eaves of the main hall and looked at everything with patience: here one can meditate on nothingness in order to be able to see it better when we return from our journeys around the spiral: here too we can remember what we have seen and what we have forgotten: here too we can cleanse our eyes and rest our heart so as not to burden them with too many images; here too we can come back from exile; hear sounds that are not words; see colors that do not exist; touch memories before they turn into dreams; open our ears before they fill up with water; wash our faces before they get covered by moss.</p>
