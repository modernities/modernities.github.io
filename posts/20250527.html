<h2>How will we live together?</h2>

<p>When you enter into this space you notice that it is interacting with you, responding to you, and being friendly with you. In some ways, you feel like you’ve been here before, but it feels new, too.</p>

<p>In this space, you still have the invitation to sleep, but your invitation is (dare I say) more meaningful (or more enjoyable) than it would be in a normal bedroom.</p>

<p>And then you fall asleep, and you have a dream that you are in a beautiful space where you are at home. A space that is exactly the same as the one in which you fell asleep, but you are not alone in this space. Someone is with you, someone you know, someone you care about, someone who cares about you.</p>
