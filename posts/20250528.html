<p>This critique was concerned with architecture and urbanism, and predicted that all that may suggest permanence could be achieved only by simulation, the “real” was doomed to become an ever-changing collage of real and fake. Architecture and urbanism no longer strive for authenticity or stability, but instead participate in an endless play of signs and images. What persists is not the built environment itself, but the simulation of permanence, a convincing fiction sustained by repetition, recognition, and the collective desire for something to hold onto when everything else keeps changing.</p>
