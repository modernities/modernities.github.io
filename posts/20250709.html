<p>Hey me, are you still around? Or is this finally it—game over, lights out, nothing left? Did you go easy, or did you fight it until the end? Does thinking about it scare you, or have you accepted it's coming anyway? Are you alone right now, or did someone stick around to see you off? Knowing me, I probably made it complicated, annoyed some people along the way, and made things messy—but whatever, that's just how it goes. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope you're still you, still holding on, still pushing through, still okay with everything that happened. But if you're already gone, that's alright too. I'll stay here for now, dealing with whatever comes, until it's my turn. And when it happens, I'll be there with you—no cheering, no bullshit, just accepting that this was it, just us, just me, and nothing more.</p>
