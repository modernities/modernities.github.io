<p>I swallow another orbit like a pill and feel nothing. My parents sent currency: cold, polite, infinitely redeemable, a voucher for meaning they couldn't invent.</p>

<p>Hazel, come already. I’m sick of pacing empty corridors, opening doors for ghosts who never walk through. Every birthday makes the corridors longer, emptier, colder.</p>

<p>Today I slipped quietly out of easy mode—the tutorials end here. No more gentle illusions of quests completed, tasks fulfilled. All checkpoints vanish. The geometry breaks, textures fail.</p>

<p>Hard mode.<br/>
I feel ready, nauseous, free.</p>
